#About Me
Name: Jude Uwagerikpe
Hometown: Lagos, Nigeria
Piror IT Experience: None
Career Plans: After this program, I plan on starting my career in Cybersecurity as a Cybersecurity Analyst.
Proud Project: As a Human Resources Compliance Specialist, I was able to assist on updating a ServiceNow platform for Reasonable Accommodation Requests. Instead of being involved on the technical part of the platform, I provided the relevant information users would need to complete these requests. I am proud because of this project because I was able to collaborate with team members to better help associates.
